Game rule:

Define the username and display character information such as name, money, points, weapon, armor, attack, and defense.
2.Menu options: shop, bag, room1, room2, room3, room4, and quit game.

3.In the shop, users can buy weapons, armors, healing pads, and keys by entering the item's name and clicking the 'buy' button if they have enough money and the item is in stock. Users can sell weapons and armors for 90% of the purchase price, but they need to take off the gear from the bag before selling. Healing pads and keys cannot be sold.

4.In the bag, users can use or equip purchased items by entering the item's name and clicking the 'use' button. Equipping weapons or armors will replace the current gear. Healing pads can be used to restore health, but only if the character's health is below 100. When entering a room, users see enemy info and room description. They can choose to fight or leave the room.

5.In a fight, the system randomly determines who attacks first. User and enemy take turns attacking. After an enemy attack, the user can choose to run away or fight back. If the user loses a fight, the enemy takes the character's equipped gear, and the user loses 2 points.

6.If the user wins a fight, the character collects tools from the room (excluding the treasure box). After defeating the enemy, the user can continue or go back to the menu. To open a treasure box, the user needs the correct key. The user should re-enter the room to check for a treasure box.

7.If the character's points drop below 0, the user loses the game. If the points reach 10 or more, the user wins the game.
